April 2021: https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1068 has UK data on vaccine efficacy for the first shot (and second but only for BNT) on around 400000 people. I originally read about it on https://www.bbc.com/news/health-56844220 but the bmj link cites two preprints about it, which I should try to understand because I'm not quite clear on whether the percentages given represent efficacy.
Meanwhile Scotland has something similar at https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00677-2/fulltext and/or https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3789264 (ugh look at which is more recent, or if they are the same, too much stuff in my brain now) which I should check whether it's the continuation of the same study I have in the links from a couple months ago.

https://covid-statistics.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ has dashboard, restrictive measures, and "API" like https://covid-statistics.jrc.ec.europa.eu/api/Measure/getMeasuresGraph/ITA/2020-02-01/2021-03-05/000000000/all
It also has a long list of documents, cfr with https://covid-19-diagnostics.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ already in the list

Try to make sense wrt the strange Danish study https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.08.21252200v1 where there would be *negative* efficacy during the first 14 days, negative by far too, but that's "adjusted" vs "unadjusted" and I certainly didn't get meaningful clarifications about that from https://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m2oqc1/realworld_evidence_confirms_high_effectiveness_of/gqloxp1/

https://github.com/ChronicDiseaseEpi/hcw/blob/master/vaccine_manuscript.pdf is a preprint of a Scottish study showing reduced transmission to households of vaccinated healthcare workers
